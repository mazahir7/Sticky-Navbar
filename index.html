    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Manchester United Football Club, commonly known as Man United or simply United, is one of the most iconic and
      successful football clubs in the world. The club was founded in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the
      Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway depot at Newton Heath. They initially played
      in the Football Alliance before joining the Football League in 1892.
      <br> <br>
      In 1902, financial struggles led to the club's name change to Manchester United, and in the following years, they
      faced challenges, including relegation to the Second Division. However, under the management of Sir Matt Busby,
      who took charge in 1945, the club saw significant success.
      <br> <br>
      The Busby Babes era refers to the 1950s, during which a young and talented team, including players like Duncan
      Edwards, Tommy Taylor, and Bobby Charlton, emerged under Busby's guidance. The team won the First Division title
      in 1956 and 1957.
      <br> <br>
      Tragically, in 1958, the Munich air disaster struck, claiming the lives of eight players and injuring others,
      shaking the club to its core. Busby rebuilt the team, and by the 1960s, United achieved remarkable success,
      winning the First Division title in 1965 and 1967. They also became the first English club to win the European Cup
      in 1968.
      <br> <br>
      After Busby's retirement, Manchester United faced a period of decline until the appointment of Sir Alex Ferguson
      in 1986. Ferguson's tenure of over 26 years is considered the most successful period in the club's history. He led
      the team to unprecedented success, winning numerous Premier League titles, FA Cups, and UEFA Champions League
      trophies. Notably, United clinched the treble in the 1998-1999 season, securing the Premier League, FA Cup, and
      Champions League trophies.
      <br> <br>
      Since Ferguson's retirement in 2013, the club has experienced ups and downs under various managers, including
      David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, and José Mourinho. Ole Gunnar Solskjær took over as caretaker manager in 2018 and was
      appointed as permanent manager later that year. While the team has shown moments of promise, they have faced
      challenges in maintaining the level of success seen during Ferguson's era.
      <br> <br>
      Manchester United's legacy is built on a rich history of success, iconic players, and a passionate fanbase. The
      club's distinctive red colors, Old Trafford stadium, and a tradition of attacking football have solidified its
      place as one of the most renowned football clubs globally.

    <h2>Old Trafford</h2>
    <p>

      Old Trafford is the iconic home stadium of Manchester United Football Club, situated in Greater Manchester,
      England. Established in 1910, it remains one of the largest and most storied football arenas in the United
      Kingdom. Over the years, Old Trafford has undergone multiple expansions and renovations, continuously modernizing
      its facilities while preserving its rich history.
      <br><br>
      Old Trafford boasts a seating capacity exceeding 74,000 spectators, making
      it a colossal venue that regularly draws massive crowds for Manchester United's home matches. The stadium is
      renowned for its electric atmosphere, with passionate fans filling its stands, notably the Stretford End, which
      houses some of the club's most vocal supporters.
      <br><br>
      <strong>The stadium comprises four main stands:</strong>
      <br><br>
      <strong>Sir Alex Ferguson Stand (formerly the North Stand):</strong> Located on the north side of Old Trafford,
      this stand was renamed in tribute to Sir Alex Ferguson, the legendary former manager of Manchester United. It
      comprises various tiers and accommodates executive suites, hospitality areas, and seating for fans. The stand
      offers excellent views of the pitch and contributes to the stadium's electric atmosphere during matches. It stands
      as a testament to Ferguson's immense contribution to the club's history and success.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Sir Bobby Charlton Stand (formerly the South Stand):</strong> Situated on the southern side of the
      stadium, this stand honors Sir Bobby Charlton, a revered figure in Manchester United's history. Similar to the Sir
      Alex Ferguson Stand, it hosts seating sections for supporters, executive boxes, and areas for corporate
      hospitality. The stand plays a pivotal role in providing a vibrant and energetic environment during matches,
      paying homage to Charlton's significant influence on the club.
      <br><br>
      <strong>East Stand:</strong> Positioned on the eastern side of Old Trafford, the East Stand boasts the largest
      single-tier structure in a UK football stadium. It accommodates a substantial number of fans and incorporates
      corporate hospitality facilities. Its design not only offers an excellent view of the game but also adds to the
      stadium's architectural grandeur, contributing to the overall appeal of Old Trafford.
      <br><br>
      <strong>West Stand:</strong> Completing the four-sided structure of the stadium, the West Stand is located on the
      western side of Old Trafford. Alongside providing seating for fans, it includes corporate sections and hospitality
      areas. The stand, like the others, plays a crucial role in enhancing the matchday experience for spectators and
      reflects the club's commitment to providing diverse facilities for its supporters and guests.
      <br><br>
      Each stand at Old Trafford has its own significance, contributing to the stadium's history and atmosphere. They
      have been subject to renovations and improvements over time to ensure they meet modern standards and provide an
      exceptional experience for fans attending matches and other events.
